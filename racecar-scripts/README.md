# make-graphs

This is a fun program written by [Micah Sherr](mailto:msherr@cs.georgetown.edu) to generate a bunch of tgen
files, each of which is intended to emulate a protocol.

Use at your own risk.

## Example usage

`python make-graphs.py --peer 192.168.0.6:8888 -s 12345 -n 50 --runs 100 -S -e ssh --run`
